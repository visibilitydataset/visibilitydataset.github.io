## What's been improved after ViViD?

This work is a proceeding work of the unpublished paper "ViViD : Vision for Visibility Dataset", best poster presentation of ICRA 2019 Workshop/Tutorial - Dataset Generation and Benchmarking of SLAM Algorithms for Robotics and VR/AR. After prior submission, the scale of experiment has been expanded to include driving sequences, with more details on dataset statistics and characteristics. Also, the models of event camera and LiDAR was changed to provide higher resolution.

There's a lot of excellent work that was introduced for SLAM Developments. For example, [Awesome SLAM Datasets](https://sites.google.com/view/awesome-slam-datasets/) lists up State-Of-The-Art SLAM datasets. And you may also want to check [Complex Urban Dataset](https://irap.kaist.ac.kr/dataset/) containing large scale and long term changes.
