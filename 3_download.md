## Development tools

If you are not familiar with rosbag files, you could use our simple image undistort & saving [python script](https://urserver.kaist.ac.kr/publicdata/ViViD++/process_img.py).
Locate the script in the same folder with the bagfile, and running the script will save your images in the folder named "rgb" or "ther". You may also find a text file containing
gps coordinate (UTM) oriented in start point of driving-campus-day1 with cooresponding timestamps, in the "gpslist.txt" file.

For saving non-image sensors as a csv or text file, simple imu / event image saver [script](https://urserver.kaist.ac.kr/publicdata/ViViD++/process_dvs.py) will help.
